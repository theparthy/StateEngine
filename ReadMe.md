#StateEngine
This Package is a very simple and hopefully easy to use State Maschine which I wrote for a side Project.

##Usage 
You can use the abstract ModelAwareStateEngine to build up an Service Class which is aware of your domain entity/model. 
For this there are a couple of abstract methods you will have to implement. In those methods you can define how to interact with your entity/model.

(new yourEntityAwareStateEngine(new TheParthy/StateEngine/StateMaschine()))->se


##TODOS
- write better Documentation (I really suck at Documenting Stuff)
- write tests
- Laravel integration
